 *
 *  This app will watch the vibration sensor for activity, and send a reminder at a chosen time of 
 *  the day to remind us to check the laundry so we don't leave anything in it overnight.  I've set my 
 *  Monoprice Shock Sensor (http://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=11988) up as a "Z-Wave Door/Window Sensor", 
 *  as that's the only consistent way I could get SmartThings to acknowledge the vibrations.  "Open" equates to 
 *  vibration, and "Closed" is interpreted as no vibration.
