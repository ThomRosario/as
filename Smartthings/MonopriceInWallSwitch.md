Programming using the Program Switch
====================================
1. Press and hold the Program Switch on the module for about 3 seconds.
2. If the LED blinks once, the module is configured for a Single Wall Switch without Indicator Light.
3. If the LED blinks twice, the module is configured for a Single Wall Switch with Indicator Light.

Apparently the default on this device is WITH indicator light (#3), which my switch is not. So I'm hoping that if I follow these steps and get the LED to blink once, it may solve my issue.
